# For many of the standard Kubernetes resources we have generic logic to detect their status.
# But for some resources, especially Custom Resources, we need more specific logic to determine
# their status. Custom rules to detect status of such resources are defined in this file.

rules:
    # Match the resource by its API group (without version)
  - resourceGroup: "acid.zalan.do"
    # Match the resource by its kind (case insensitive)
    resourceKind: "postgresql"
    # JSON Path to match the single field in the resource live manifest (get the manifest via
    # `kubectl get -o json`). This is the field that we will monitor to determine the resource
    # status.
    jsonPath: "$.status.PostgresClusterStatus"
    # JSON Path in more human-readable form, used only in deploy logs to inform the user of the
    # field that we are monitoring. Anything can be here, it does not need to be a valid JSON
    # path, but it should be informative.
    humanJsonPath: "status.PostgresClusterStatus"
    # Fill out conditions as much as possible. Quality of tracking and error detection depends on
    # this.
    conditions:
      # If the field that we got via JSON Path has value "Running", then we consider the resource
      # to be ready. Status tracking for this resource stopped immediately.
      ready:
        - "Running"
      # If the field that we got via JSON Path has value "Creating" or "Updating", then we
      # consider the resource neither ready nor failed yet. Status tracking for this resource
      # will continue.

      # If the field that we got via JSON Path has value "CreateFailed" or "UpdateFailed" or

      # resource will stop if the error threshold (configurable by the user) is reached. The
      # deployment will fail (configurable by the user).
